            <div class="article-content">
                <p>The AI revolution is accelerating, and many developers are asking crucial questions about their future:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>How many people can truly work on algorithm optimization?</p>
                    <p>Are most junior and mid-level developers becoming dispensable in the face of AI?</p>
                    <p>Even for senior developers, will their importance diminish significantly if business logic isn't complex enough or technology doesn't involve low-level optimization?</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>If the answer to these questions is yes, then for most people, what truly matters may not be chasing those hard-to-reach algorithm positions, but rather <strong>learning to identify others' needs</strong> and thinking about how to use <strong>English and AI tools</strong> to meet those needs for compensation.</p>

                <p>In other words: In the AI era, a programmer's core value is no longer just writing code, but <strong>using AI as a tool to solve real-world problems</strong>.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Path 1: AI Tool Freelancer</h2>
                <p>This is the most realistic path with the lowest barrier to entry. You don't need to master AI fundamentals, but rather learn how to use AI tools effectively, combining programming with English communication to fulfill client needs.</p>

                <h3>Common Work Forms Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using GPT/Claude to help clients write copy, generate code snippets, and create reports</li>
                    <li>Using Midjourney/Stable Diffusion to generate illustrations and materials</li>
                    <li>Combining basic development skills to quickly build small tools and websites</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key to this category is: finding things that others need but can't do themselves, or are too lazy to do, then delivering quickly with AI assistance.</p>

                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <p><strong>✅ Advantages:</strong> Quick results, potentially landing clients within 1-3 months</p>
                    <p><strong>⚠️ Disadvantages:</strong> Intense market competition, low client retention</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <h2>Path 2: Vertical Domain Entrepreneur</h2>
                <p>If you're willing to take on more risk, consider deeply integrating AI with a specific industry to solve real pain points.</p>

                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Education Industry</strong> → AI personalized tutoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Industry</strong> → AI-assisted diagnostic tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Gaming Industry</strong> → AI automated level design, script generation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This path requires you to understand both technology and industry pain points. More than "being able to code," what matters is whether you can find essential scenarios and transform AI into products.</p>

                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <p><strong>✅ Advantages:</strong> Massive returns once you hit the right opportunity</p>
                    <p><strong>⚠️ Disadvantages:</strong> Requires investment in development and marketing, high failure rate</p>
                    <p><strong>⏳ Return Cycle:</strong> Usually takes 6-18 months to validate</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <h2>Path 3: System/Infrastructure Expert</h2>
                <p>The final category is the most technically demanding path. Large-scale AI deployment requires massive computational optimization, algorithm optimization, and system scheduling behind the scenes. These positions are concentrated in big tech companies and research institutions, with extremely high barriers but equally irreplaceable value.</p>

                <h3>Involved Directions Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Algorithm optimization (C/C++/CUDA parallel computing)</li>
                    <li>System architecture and distributed scheduling</li>
                    <li>Chip and hardware-level optimization</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This path requires <strong>solid mathematical foundations and system optimization capabilities</strong>, with a long learning cycle, typically taking <strong>2-5 years</strong> to enter core positions.</p>

                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <p><strong>✅ Advantages:</strong> Rare, high salary</p>
                    <p><strong>⚠️ Disadvantages:</strong> High learning barrier, difficult for most people to persist</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>AI hasn't made everyone worthless, but has accelerated "value restructuring."</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Average programmers</strong> can choose to quickly enter the market as AI tool freelancers</li>
                    <li><strong>Visionary individuals</strong> can deeply cultivate specific vertical domains to build products</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech enthusiasts</strong> can move toward infrastructure optimization to become rare experts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key question isn't "Will AI replace me?" but rather:</p>

                <p><strong>In the AI world, where can I position myself?</strong></p>
