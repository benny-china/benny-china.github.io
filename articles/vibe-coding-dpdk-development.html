                    <h2>Preface</h2>
                    
                    <p>High-performance network programming has always been a technical highland in system development, especially for network application development based on DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit). Due to its complex memory management, multi-threading models, and hardware interaction mechanisms, it often requires extensive professional knowledge accumulation and development experience. However, with the development of AI-assisted programming tools, particularly the emerging collaborative development model of "vibe coding," new possibilities have emerged for the development of such complex systems.</p>

                    <p>This article will share our experience of applying vibe coding in high-performance network development based on a real project case - using DPDK to refactor an IP traffic detection system. We'll explore how this development model compressed what would traditionally take half a year into 5 days of development, along with the lessons learned in the process.</p>

                    <h3>2.2 Vibe Coding Workflow</h3>

                    <p>In our DPDK project, the typical vibe coding workflow is as follows:</p>

                        <li>Formulate development plan</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>2. Code Generation Phase</strong></p>

                    <h2>3. Project Case Study: DPDK IP Traffic Detection System Refactoring</h2>

                    <h3>3.1 Project Background</h3>

                    <p>The original project was an IP traffic monitoring system implemented based on VPP (Vector Packet Processing), with main functions including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time network traffic statistics</li>
                        <li>IP address-level traffic analysis</li>
                        <li>DDoS attack detection and protection</li>
                        <li>Configurable threshold alerting mechanism</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Due to VPP's performance bottlenecks and maintenance complexity in specific scenarios, we decided to re-implement the entire system using DPDK.</p>

                    <h3>3.2 Technical Architecture Design</h3>

                    <p>Through vibe coding methods, we quickly determined the system architecture:</p>

                    <p><strong>Core Component Structure:</strong></p>
                    <div class="code-block">

└── antiddosctl.c      # Control command-line tool
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Key Technical Implementation:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>1. High-Performance Packet Processing Engine</strong> (analysis.c)</p>
                    <div class="code-block">

                    <h3>3.3 Core Functionality Implementation</h3>

                    <p><strong>Traffic Statistics Functionality:</strong><br>
                    The system can collect real-time statistics for each IP address including packet count, byte count, SYN/UDP/ICMP packet counts and other metrics, and supports filtered debug output by protocol type.</p>

                    <p><strong>Detection Mechanism:</strong><br>
                    Implemented sliding window-based threshold detection mechanism. When traffic from a certain IP exceeds configured thresholds, it triggers alerts and records to snapshot data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Configuration Management:</strong><br>
                    Supports runtime configuration modifications including detection thresholds, detection cycles, interface probing switches, etc., without requiring service restart.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>Through this practical experience of DPDK traffic detection system refactoring, we deeply appreciate the enormous potential of vibe coding in high-performance network development. Completing what would traditionally take half a year in 5 days is not just an improvement in development efficiency, but represents an entirely new software development paradigm.</p>

                    <p>However, we must also clearly recognize that vibe coding is not a universal silver bullet. It is more like a powerful tool that requires developers to have solid foundational knowledge, clear requirement analysis capabilities, and keen problem insight. Only within the framework of human-machine collaboration can its true value be realized.</p>

                    <p>Looking to the future, as AI technology continues to develop, vibe coding has the potential to become the standard working model for high-performance system development. This will open the door to high-performance computing and network programming fields for more developers, promoting the technological democratization process of the entire industry.</p>

                    <p>For every technical professional, now is the best time to embrace this new model and learn how to effectively collaborate with AI. The future of software development will be the perfect combination of human creativity and AI capabilities.</p>
